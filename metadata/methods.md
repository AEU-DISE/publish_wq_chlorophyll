**Field Methods**

Water quality parameters are recorded at the start of each sampling event. Water temperature (degrees Celsius), electrical conductivity (microSiemens/cm), specific conductance (microSiemens/cm), pH, dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and turbidity (FNU) are sampled with a YSI ProDSS handheld meter. Turbidity values are averaged over three readings. Secchi depth is measured in the shade. Light attenuation (subsurface irradiance) is measured with a light meter (LI-COR LI-250A) at the surface, and at 75%, 50%, 25%, and 1% of the surface reference value in the water. The corresponding depth and measured micromoles are noted. Tide, condition of sampling (condition code), Microcystis level, and weather are also recorded with water quality parameters. Please see the YBFMP SOP on Lower Trophic Sample Collection for more details. 

Water quality and phytoplankton samples are collected in a Van Dorn. 1-L Nalgene Collection bottles are rinsed three times with sample water before being filled from the Van Dorn and are stored in a cooler with ice while being transported to the laboratory for filtration, homogenization, transfer, and preservation (depending on sample type). 

**Lab Methods**

*Filtration*
For each sample of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a, between 80-500 mL of sample water is passed through a 47 mm diameter glass fiber filter with a 1.0 micrometer pore size at a pressure of 10 inches of mercury. After filtration, the filters are immediately frozen and transported to DWR's Bryte Laboratory for analysis within 48 hours of collection (Standard Methods, 19th edition).	

Orthophosphate (dissolved), dissolved nitrite + nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, dissolved calcium, dissolved chloride, total dissolved solids, and dissolved silica surface are filtered immediately after returning to the laboratory. The samples are filtered through a 0.45 micrometer pore size mixed cellulous ester membrane filter into one-pint polyethylene bottles, one of the bottles being an actual sample bottle turned into Bryte for analysis and the other being a designated filtration bottle which is rinsed between sites that are being filtered. The filtered water either remains in the one-pint sample bottle or is transferred from the designated filtration bottle to acidified half pint bottles (one with HNO3 and one with H2SO4). All waters samples are stored in the refrigerator and the chlorophyll filter samples are stored in the freezer. All samples are then transported to Bryte Laboratory within 48 hours for analysis.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) samples are filtered using a metal DOC filtration system. The samples are filtered through a 45 micrometer pore size mixed cellulous ester membrane filter. A glass flask is triple rinsed with DI and then 20-30 mLs of sample water are filtered and used to rinse the flask three times. Water is then filtered and transferred to a 40 ml glass vial that is pre-preserved with phosphoric acid.

For phytoplankton, a sample is carefully poured from one of the collection bottles into a 50mL amber bottle prefilled with 1mL of Lugol’s solution to preserve and stain specimens. The amber bottle is capped, and all samples are stored in the dark at room temperature for at least two weeks before shipping samples to BSA Environmental Services, Inc. for taxonomic identification, measurements, and enumeration.

Please see the YBFMP SOP on Lower Trophic Sample Collection for more details.

*Contractor Phytoplankton Methods*
Currently, phytoplankton samples are analyzed by BSA Environmental, Inc. Phytoplankton are identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible using the Utermöhl method and APHA standard methods (Utermöhl 1958, APHA 1998). An aliquot is allowed to settle onto a counting chamber for a minimum of 12 hours. The aliquot volume is adjusted according to the algal population density and turbidity of the sample. For the Delta, the aliquot volume is usually about 10 ml. Aliquots are enumerated at a magnification of 630X using a Leica DMIL inverted microscope. For each settled aliquot, phytoplankton in randomly chosen transects are counted and photos are taken of the specimen, first encounter; measurements are made with an ocular micrometer. Taxa are enumerated as they appear along the transects. A minimum of 400 total algal units are counted, and a minimum of 100 algal units of the dominant taxon. For taxa that are in filaments or colonies, the number of cells per filament or colony is recorded. Length measurements are performed on 25 algal units of the dominant taxon, and up to 5 units of each minor taxon. The measurements taken are 1st greatest axial length, 2nd greatest axial length, and 3rd greatest axial length.

Organism counts for each sample can be converted to organisms/ml using the following formula:
Organisms/ml = (C x Ac) / (V x Af x F)
where:
C = count obtained
Ac = Area of cell bottom (mm2)
Af = Area of each grid field (mm2)
F = Number of fields examined
V = volume settled, in ml
This simplifies to:
Organisms/ml = C / cV
where:
C = count obtained
cV = counted volume, in ml (cV = Ac /(V x Af x F))
Algal biovolume can be calculated from the dimensions using, for example, the formulas given for different algal shapes by Kellar et al. (1980).

**Sample Processing and Tracking**

**Sample Tracking**

Water quality samples are tracked using an internal system called FLIMS. A chain of custody (COC) listing sample number, date, time, location, and study/project is sent to Byte Labs, who check that all samples are accounted for and turned in at the correct temperature. Signatures are required of both the person responsible for dropping off the samples, and the person receiving it. 

For phytoplankton, a chain of custody (COC) listing sample ID, station, date, time, number of vials/bottles, sample type, and study/project is sent to the taxonomy contractor (BSA Environmental Services, Inc.) who upon receipt check that all samples are accounted for and undamaged. Signatures are required of both the person responsible for dropping off the samples, and the person receiving it.

**Quality Assurance and Control**

**Instrument Specifications**

All YSI ProDSS instrumentation is specified in the ProDSS Manual. 

All laboratory instrumentation is listed in the Bryte Lab Quality Manual.

**Calibrations**

YSIs are calibrated for Specific Conductance, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, and turbidity monthly. YSI temperature readings are verified twice per year: once using a 5-point validation and once using a 2-point validation. Please see the YBFMP SOP on ProDSS Calibration for more detail. 
Prior to sample analysis of conventional and inorganic constituents in water, external calibrations will be made using 3 - 5 standards that cover the range of sample concentrations. The lowest standard will be at or near the Method Detection Limit (MDL). Linear regression will be <0.995 or better. Calibration verification will be run after every 20 samples after the initial calibration and will use a standard source that is different from that used for the initial calibration. Acceptable recovery for conventional analytes is 80 - 120% and for inorganic analytes is 90 - 110%.

See Bryte Chemical Laboratory Quality Manual for additional details.

**Replicates/Duplicates/Blanks**

Equipment blanks - A blank is created for each day of sampling for a subset of nutrient samples, for a total of two equipment blanks. DI water is used to rinse sampling equipment, and then the equipment is filled with DI water and distributed for filtering or filling non-filtered bottles. Blanks are run for: dissolved ammonia, dissolved orthophosphate, dissolved nitrate + nitrate, total kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus. 
Replicates - A replicate chlorophyll sample is taken for each site. The same amount of sample water as the parent sample is filtered to create this replicate sample. 

Laboratory Control Samples - Laboratory control samples (LCS) provide bias information about a laboratory's ability to perform acceptable analyses on a clean matrix with the chosen methods. The LCS will be prepared by the laboratory using an aliquot of the clean matrix (e.g., water, sediment, or tissue with no detectable levels of the target analytes) that is spiked with the analytes at known concentrations. The lab results must be within 80-120% recovery or control limits based on 3 times the standard deviation of a lab's actual method recoveries for the target analytes to be acceptable.

Matrix Spikes - Matrix Spikes (MS) provide bias information on sample preparation and analysis. MS will be used to verify that the lab can determine if the sample matrix is causing either a positive or negative bias on sample results. MS samples will be prepared by the laboratory using an aliquot of the sample matrix (e.g., water sediment, or tissue) that is spiked with the analytes at known concentrations. The lab results must be within 80-120% recovery or control limits based on 3 times the standard deviation of a lab's actual method recoveries for the target analytes to be acceptable.

Matrix Spike Duplicates - Matrix spike duplicates (MSD) provide precision information on sample preparation and analysis. The laboratory will prepare separate spiked matrix samples (MS) for analysis. Acceptable lab results for bias are the same as described for matrix spikes. The duplicate values must have a RPD of less than 25% to be acceptable.

Laboratory Duplicates - Laboratory duplicates provide precision information on the analytical methods with the target analytes. The laboratory will generate the duplicate samples by splitting one sample into two parts, each of which will be analyzed separately. The duplicate values must have an RPD of less than 25% to be acceptable.

**Sample Identification**
For phytoplankton, the contractor must provide photographic documentation of taxon (species or genus) identification when it is first encountered. This includes all algal taxa and all non-algal protists. A taxon and appropriate life-stages will be photographed only once. There must be only one taxon per photograph. For each organism that cannot be identified, the Contractor provides photographic documentation in case the organism(s) are identified later. DWR requires a permanent reference mount of certain taxa (for example, when a new species is discovered) from the contractor.

**Data Quality Control**

Three levels of quality control are conducted on field data: 

Field data are checked by someone other than the data recorder prior to leaving each field site

Datasheets are checked while being entered into the Microsoft Access database, which has customized error-checking and data validation checks

A separate DWR staff member compares data from original field sheets to data entered into the database

DWR's Field and Laboratory Information Management System (FLIMS) is used to track water quality field and lab data from collection in the field to final use and storage. Prior to each monthly water quality run, FLIMS is used to generate the paperwork (sample identification numbers, labels, chain of custody sheets, etc.) for each field run. The data collected in the field is recorded on field sheets and is typically entered into FLIMS the next day or before samples are submitted to Bryte Lab. Staff at Bryte Lab enters laboratory data directly in FLIMS that is uploaded to the Water Data Library (WDL) when all the data for one field day has been entered. If there is missing field and lab data, discrepancies between data on field sheets and WDL, or the data does not meet quality objectives, the Lower Tropic Lead is notified and corrections are made, or the data is flagged appropriately.

**Laboratory Data Quality Control**

Data received from the taxonomy contractor are checked for accuracy and completeness by the contract manager at DWR and any issues are communicated between the contract manager and contractor.

**Notes on Data Quality: **

Please see the historical changes section for changes in sampling methods.

**Archiving**

Water quality samples are disposed of once analysis is complete.

After taxonomic identification and enumeration by the contractor, phytoplankton samples are shipped back to DWR where they are stored for 5 years and then disposed of.

**Data Storage**

Water Quality data can be accessed on the Department of Water Resources Water Data Library:
https://wdlbeta.water.ca.gov/Map.aspx

Taxonomic results are received from the contractor via email in an Excel spreadsheet. Electronic copies of results for taxonomic analyses are archived on DWR/AEU Network drives. 


**Historical Changes**

**Methods:**

From May 2019 until November 2020: 0.45 micrometer MCE filters used for nutrient filtration (NO2+NO3, O-Phos, NH3, DON) were soaked in DI water for at least 4 hours before use. The water was changed after filters had soaked for an hour, and the hour soaking was repeated a total of 4 times.

11/19/20: Bryte updated preservation methods for some constituents. TKN, TPhos, NO2+NO3, O-Phos, NH3, and DON were previously stored in unacidified half pint bottles and frozen. The new protocol is to add 250 mLs of sample water into a bottle with H2SO4 and to store at 5 degree C. 

June 2021- creation of the blank sample water was standardized. Previously a sample of DI from the lab faucet was filtered. Now the DI is passed through whichever sampling vessel was used (churn splitter or van dorn) and then added to a designated blank 1L Nalgene bottle. 

June 2021- the filter used to filter the DOC sampled changed from a combusted 1 micrometer glass fiber filter to a 0.45 micrometer MCE filter. Use of a glass filtering flask and a vacuum pump was also added to the DOC filtering protocol. 

October 2021- water grabs in the field are now standardized to use the van dorn in order to take a homogenized sample.
