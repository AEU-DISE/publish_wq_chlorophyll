The Yolo Bypass Fish Monitoring Program (YBFMP) operates a rotary screw trap and fyke trap and conducts biweekly beach seine and lower trophic surveys in addition to maintaining water quality instrumentation in the bypass. The YBFMP serves to fill information gaps regarding environmental conditions in the bypass that trigger migrations and enhanced survival and growth of native fishes, as well as provide data for IEP synthesis efforts. YBFMP staff also conduct analyses of YBFMP monitoring data to address pertinent management related questions as identified by IEP. The Yolo Bypass has been identified as a high restoration priority by the National Marine Fisheries Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinions for Delta Smelt, Winter and Spring-run Chinook salmon and by California EcoRestore. The YBFMP informs the restoration actions that are mandated or recommended in these plans and provides critical baseline data on the ecology of the bypass and how it interacts with the broader San Francisco Estuary. Only juvenile and adult fish catch with associated water quality are presented in this dataset. Our overall program objectives include:

1.	Collect baseline data on water quality, chlorophyll, lower trophic level biota, and fish in the Yolo Bypass to monitor spatial and temporal changes in trends and abundance. 
2.	Analyze and communicate Yolo Bypass data with stakeholders and the scientific and management communities to address pertinent management related questions. 
3.	Provide technical expertise on Yolo Bypass aquatic ecology and monitoring and sampling methods.

Specifically, the objectives of the water quality monitoring are to: 

1.	Examine spatial and temporal trends in water quality.
2.	Examine the relationship between water quality and biological observations. 

We sample physical water quality discretely when conducting biological monitoring using a YSI ProDSS. Nutrient and chlorophyll data are taken biweekly along with lower trophic tows. Water is sampled at three sites along the Yolo Bypass and Sacramento River, then processed and analyzed by an internal DWR laboratory.
